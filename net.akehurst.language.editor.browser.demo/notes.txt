1. Show demo in web browser
 a. Datatype language
 b. add a property
 c. add a class
 d. note class class ....keywords as identifiers not an issue
 c. note colouring....esp scan vs parse colouring
2. It is all done browser side, there is no backend (in the demo)
3. GLR based algorithm...not restrictions on grammar rules (left/right recursive)
4. context sensitive scanning ... no keyword restrictions
5. ambiguous grammars are slow!
6. unambiguous grammars parse in linear time
7. Integration with Ace and Monaco...not hard to integrate with other editors if required.
8. All done at runtime...first time use is slower (needs to build the parser)
9. Flexibility...easy to modify the grammar or styling at runtime.
10. Two forms of grammar composition, extension and embedding
11. Maturity:
 - Current Implementation is 5 years in development, though its based on previous work that goes back 15 years.
 - used in 1 research project, 1 customer prototype project, in itemis YMV product.
12. Future Plans:
 - Formatter
 - Performance improvements
 - Semantic Analyser
